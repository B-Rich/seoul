	Vancouver - a VMM
	#################


cmdline
=======

The order of the options is relevant, as some options automatically
number the instances and other devices (e.g. PCIHostBridge,
AhciController) need to exist to be able to connect them to each
other.

:mapvga:	      map the second console of Vancouver as VGA backend to the guest.

sigma0.nova options
===================

:sigma0::attach:	attach this module to the previous one to start. Modules attached to sigma0 are used as virtual disks.
:sigma0::fiascohack:	Fiascos himem allocator has a bug, it will overwrite attached modules. Enable a workaround for that.
:sigma0::console:n: 	attach n consoles to this module. Example: "sigma0::attach:2" is used for vancouver.nova to have a
		    	console for the VMM and another for the guest.
:sigma0::mem:n		give n MB memory to the task to start. Use "sigma0::mem:128" for 128 megabytes of tasks memory.
:sigma0::startlate:	do not start the modules on bootup. Use the magic keys to start them later.
:sigma0::drive:n:       attach the drive number n to this module. Use "sigma0::drive:0" for the first drive.
:pciirq:bus,devicefun,value:
			override the irq of an PCI device
:sigma0::kbnomod:       disable keyboard modifier CTRL-ALT; usefull for ncurses mode under Qemu

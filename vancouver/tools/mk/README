* Introduction

  The build system should not be a bottleneck, especially building a
  single application needs to be fast, as it is done many times a day.
  Furthermore, with multi-cores everywhere parallel building is
  mandatory.

  Hectic is an event based system...


* Requirements
	* partial builds
	* parallel build
	* fast and simple
	* support for different repositories that extend and shadow the sources
	* libraries
	* extensible
* todo
	* build goals only once
	* general caching
	* parallelize the goal search
	* cache stats


* The local Hectic file
